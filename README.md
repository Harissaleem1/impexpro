# Impex Alliance Group Website

Next.js App Router website for Impex-Pro with MongoDB-backed blog and activities CMS, password-only admin login, Gmail SMTP contact notifications, Cloudinary media uploads, and admin portal replies.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
npm install
```

Create `.env` in the project root before using the app locally. See `docs/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` and `docs/MONGODB_SETUP.md`.

You can start from the template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Next.js, usually `http://localhost:3000`.

## Important Notes

- `.env` is not generated automatically.
- `.env.example` lists every required local and production variable without secrets.
- MongoDB Atlas is required for blogs, activities, contact submissions, and admin reply threads.
- Local JSON storage is removed from the active app workflow.
- Public site details live in `lib/site-config.ts`.
- Admin login is password-only.

## Admin

Go to `/admin/login` and enter the configured admin password.

Generate a password hash:

```bash
npm run hash-password -- "your-password"
```

Paste the generated hash into `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` in `.env` or production environment variables.

## Required Environment Variables

These are required locally in `.env` and on Vercel in Project Settings -> Environment Variables:

```env
MONGODB_URI=
MONGODB_DB=impexpro
AUTH_SECRET=
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_USER=
SMTP_PASS=
CONTACT_RECEIVER_EMAIL=
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
```

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run start
npm run hash-password -- "new-password"
npm run db:indexes
```
